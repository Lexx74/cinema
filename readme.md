# Cinema

Cinema is a web application built with Laravel 5.2 in order to provide a management system for a cinema company. It was the final project of the course of web programming at the University of Trento.

## Why?
It was written with Java Servlet. But, since I don't like Java much, I decided to rewrite the entire project with a modern framework. Also I'm trying to extends the initial project with useful feature.

## The future
Obviusly it's not perfect and it will never be since I do it in my free time and just for fun/learning, but I developed the system thinking as it will be used in a semi-real world.
